Hands-on Robotics 2022 Green Team - Overview

The src folder contains the following files:

movePlans.py:
High level plan to wrap real and simultated motion also contains auton class

myRobotRealIX.py:
Describes the real robot motion, move forwards/back, lift wheels, turn

myRobotSimIX.py:
Describes the simulated robot motion, move forwards/back, lift wheels, turn

robotSimulator.py:
Controls waypointTask communication and keybind actions

How the files relate:
robotSimulator.py runs and connects to either WaypointTask run on localhost or a specified IP and starts imports the simulated or real robotIX if the -r flag is turned on. Key presses are captured in the robotSimulator loop and then calls functions in respective files.

General Theory:
Running robotSimulator.py allows real or simulated robot control and communicates with WaypointTask.py
